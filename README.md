# Plutus-notes-tokens
Tokens Created with handwritten notes to promote the work and information provided in the Plutus Pioneer Program. 

YOU MUST HAVE A FULLY RUNNING CARDANO NODE TO USE SCRIPT

The goal of this project is to provide a creative way to illustrate the information and major themes derived from the plutus pioneer program. One of the most enlightneing part of this journey is the use of Cardano-Cli to create the tokens. At first it just started as a paste and copy exersice from https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/minting, but as I continued in my studies I started to find meaning in the lines of code I was copying. It's been very satisfying watching the lines of code I was copying now have meaning. I have included the modified bash (Linux) scpript I use to create the tokens! I hope you find it a helpful way to reinforce what you've learned! I have included links to the Tokens below:
